# Code-test

1. insure the Node.js npm and webpack are installed on your laptop. 
2. run "vue init webpack project-name" on the command line to create a initial vue project by webpack. After created, you can see the catalog of the project.
3. run "npm install" to add project dependencies and "npm run dev" to start the project. The website will shows on http://localhost:8080
4. we need to change the src files because the src catalog is the develop catalog of vue project.
5. we first edit the main.js file, this is the entry of pre-compile project
6. then we edit the App.vue file and add the router of our views folder (contains login/register/profile pages)
7. add views folder and create login, register, profile.vue files
